// Welcome to the magical zoo! Your task is to create and manage a list of magical creatures. Let's have some fun!

// 1. Declare a variable named 'creatureName' and assign it a magical creature's name as a string.



// 2. Declare a variable named 'creatureDescription' and describe its magical properties as a string.


// 3. Do you believe that this creature is friendly to humans? 
// Declare a variable named 'isFriendly' and assign it a boolean value.



// 4. The magical zoo has an age restriction! Declare a variable named 'visitorAge' and assign it a random age between 1 and 60.
// Hint: Use Math.floor() to round a number down.
// Hint: Use Math.random() for generating random numbers.



// 5. Determine if the visitor is allowed to see the creature.
// Declare a variable named 'canVisit' and assign it an expression to see 
// if the visitorAge variable is greater than 15.
// Hint: use this resource if you need support: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_booleans.asp
